"""
Dataset: titanic.csv
Problem Statement:
      
Itâ€™s a real-world data containing the details of 
titanic ships passengers list.
Import the  dataset "titanic.csv"
Answer the Following:
How many people survived the disaster ?
How many people died ?
Calculate the survival rates as proportions (percentage)
Males that survived vs males that passed away
Females that survived vs Females that passed away      
Does age play a role in the survival?
Since it's probable that children were saved first.
